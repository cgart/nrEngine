Plugins are used to extend the functionality of the engine.
Plugins are loaded at the running time, so they are fully dynamicaly.
All new classes could not safely be exported to the application, because
of different memory used by the applicaton and dyanmic library. Use
Bindings for this approach.

So plugins are RunningTime-Plugins (Libraries)
Bindings are LoadTime-Plugins
