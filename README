The engine was written by me during my time as an undergrad, and now I decided to upload it to the public. I used it later during my PhD in several projects which helped me to build nice rendering demos showing our research results.

Description:

nrEngine is a small but powerfull game-application-engine. The engine does provide the developers with a low level functionality like resource managment, scripting, event system etc. A plugin framework allows to improve the functionality of the engine on the fly. The engine is written in Standard C++ and runs on all common platforms.

The engine has been designed with the goal of providing the developers a simple but powerfull API. It is not designed to be a replacement but an enrichment in the development process of a game or any other application.

Features

Kernel/Task subsystem, see: KernelTask
Resource managment, see: ResourceManagement
Clock/Timer support
Scripting system (incl. Plugin to handle  Lua scripts), see: ScriptSystem, LuaPlugin
Event managment system, see: EventManagement
Property managment system handling non-typed values
Packages provide new features during compile-time (i.e. nrEngineGLFW, ...), see: EnginePackages
Plugins extending features at run-time (i.e. lua scripting, ...), see: EnginePlugins


Compilation:

First you have to compile the engine:
	make

if you want to install the engine later in a non default directory, then call
	make prefix=/path/as/prefix

To install engine type:
	make install (to install into default directory /usr/local)
	make INST_LOCATION=/path/to/install (to install into another directory)
