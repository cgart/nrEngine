Packages are components of the engine which can not be exported as a Plugin.
Plugins are loaded dynamicaly at the runtime, however packages are
dynamicaly linked by compiling the application using nrEngine.


Packages provide some new functionality to the engine by declaring new 
classes and methods which can be used within an application.
i.e. new type of event classes NewEvent which has later to be casted from Event
to NewEvent class type. If we use a library as plugin, so load it at
runtime, we can not cast them properly because of problem of two separate
memories for the plugin and application. However if we link at at
compiletime so they can safely be casted.

So think on Packages as LoadTime-Plugins (dll/so) files.
Plugins are RunningTime-Plugins
